# Project Cuju

Project Cuju is a simple web page that displays the next football matches and in which portuguese channels they can be watched.

## Technologies

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The page will automatically fetch the latest news from the RSS feed and display it in a table.

### Filtering

To filter the results, simply enter a search term in the search box at the top of the page. The table will update in real time to show only the results that match your search.

### Styling

This project uses a modern, minimalist design with a black and white color scheme. The table is fully responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes.
